In this project we worked to incorporate everyones roles in the team to first detect a marker with a camera and find where in the camera frame that marker is.
Then we sent the detected marker data over I2C to an arduino which then moved a wheel to a certain angle depending on where the marker is in the frame. 

The motor is controlled by an Arduino and a motor shield that is attached to it. The Arduino regularly receives a value between 1 and 4 from the Raspberry Pi over I2C communication based on the current location of the Aruco marker. These values each indicate a position to which the motor should rotate (1 = 0 radians, 2 = PI/2 radians, 3 = PI radians, 4 = 3PI/2 radians). When a desired position is known, the motor is driven to that position using a generic PID controller. In this application however, the I and D terms were not needed and so were set to zero. This is because the system is essentially a first-order system with little mass and lots of natural damping. Finally, the Arduino sends back the current precise position of the motor, in radians, over I2C back to the Raspberry Pi, so that the Pi can display the position on an LCD.
