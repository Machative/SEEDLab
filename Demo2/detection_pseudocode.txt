Part 1, find how tall the marker is in pixels when approximately 1 foot away. Have the robot drive forward until the aruco marker takes up more vertical pixels than when the marker
is 1 foot away.

Part 2, the marker will be 3-5 feet away.To find how far away marker is, take measurements of how many vertical pixels the marker is when right in front of the robot, have the 
robot drive until the marker takes up close to that many pixels.

After measurements, when the marker (50mm x 50mm) is 1 foot away, the marker is approximately 100 pixels tall, to meet the requirement of being within a foot, set lower
bound to 130 pixels. So drive forward until marker is 130 pixels in height, then stop.
